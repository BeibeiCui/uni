I would like to use the opportunity to acknowledge the help of the people, who led me through and stood by during my work on this master's thesis.

First of all, I would like to express my thanks to my supervisor Prof.~Dr.~Bj\"{o}rn Ommer for the opportunity to work on the interesting topic, for his wise supervision, patience and support. I also would like to express my gratitude to Borislav Antic for his valuable suggestions and discussions regarding the topic of this thesis. I venerate their passion to science and I am grateful for their ability to inspire everybody around them with it.

Additionally I want to thank my colleagues in the Computer Vision group for the pleasant working atmosphere and for many funny moments during my presence in the group.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their endless believe in me. Especially, my farther Mikhail Tikhonchev and boyfriend Michael Sutter for their patience to read this work and help with the English grammar, for cheering me up and just for being always there for me when needed.

Thank you!
