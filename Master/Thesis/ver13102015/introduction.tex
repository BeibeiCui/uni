\chapter{Introduction}
The graph theory is one of the oldest and widely used branches of the discrete mathematics. Graphs have found an application in almost all fields of the computer science including image processing and computer vision. The reason for such a success is their simple way to model pairwise relationships between different objects. In terms of image processing and computer vision those objects can be presented by image regions, image features or even separate pixels. Such graph representation helps often to transform an existing practical problem into good investigated problem of graph theory. An example, one of the central problems in computer vision -- image matching. %object recognition.
Using a graph representation of images based on their extracted features this problem can be formulated as a graph matching problem. Although the last is not easy to solve (the most of graph matching problems are known to be NP-hard), there are a lot of approximative algorithms, that solve it in polynomial time.
Depending on the used formulation and solution techniques the complexity
The aim of this master thesis was to develop a novel matching technique of graphs that represent an image pair.

In the chapter~\ref{chapter:GM} we give the general formulation of the graph matching problem together with its variations. Generally, there are two big groups: exact and inexact matching. The first group represents more strict requirements on the desirable mapping that are however difficult to fulfill working with formulations arose from the practical field. For that reason we focus on the second group, where graph matching is formulated as an optimization problem.  We show different ways how to formulate the optimization problem and how different formulations are related to each other.
For both groups we give a short overview of existing algorithms for solving problem inside of the group.

The chapter~\ref{chapter:2levelGM} describes the novel two level graph matching framework based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. We explain in details the each single step of the purposed technique. 

In the chapter~\ref{chapter:results} we report results of evaluation of the proposed framework on synthetic generated graphs and real images. The last chapter gives a summary of the achieved results. There we also suggest possible improvements of the developed framework and talk about future work.

%Unfortunately, most of the existing algorithms are not suitable to work with bigger  Experiments in most of the papers consider graphs with up to $100$ nodes \cite{Cho2014_Haystack, Cho2010_RRWM, Cho2012_ProgressiveGM}.

%%In the present work we propose a novel approach for matching graph based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
%The present master thesis addresses the problem of graph matching and its application for finding correspondences between points on two images.  The task of the graph matching problem is to find a mapping between node set of the one graph into node set of the other graph that satisfies some conditions. In the chapter~\ref{chapter:GM} we give the general formulation of the graph matching problem together with its variations. Often the graph matching problems are subdivided into two groups: exact and inexact matching. As we saw, problems in the first group are to strict to be applied to real world problems. For that reason we focus on the second group, where graph matching is formulated as an optimization problem. We show different ways how to formulate this optimization problem and how those formulations are related to each other. Additionally, we provide in chapter~\ref{chapter:GM} an extensive overview of the resent algorithms for solving inexact graph matching problems.

%The most general formulation of graph matching problem uses a so-called affinity matrix to measure similarity between two graphs. As it has been shown, this problem formulation represents a special case of quadratic assignment problem, which is known to be NP-hard. Due to the big size of the affinity matrix most of existing graph matching algorithms, that use this formulation, are not suitable to work fast on graphs with more than $100$ nodes each. For that reason, we suggest a framework, which allows the application of existing algorithms to bigger graphs. The detailed explanation of the proposed technique is given in the chapter~\ref{chapter:2levelGM}. Our idea is based on the well known divide-and-conquer paradigm. We subdivide a given graph matching problem, which is too big to be solved directly, into a set of non-overlapping smaller problems. This is done in a way, that each single subproblem can be solved fast with the existing methods. An overall solution is represented by a combination of the local solutions of the subproblem. 
%Each sub
%To partition graph we suggest two methods. The first one puts a grid with fix number of cells over the graphs and captures nodes inside one cell into one cluster. The second method iteratively replaces edges in the independent edge sets of the graphs with a single node until the desirable size of graphs is reached. Generally, each other partition method can be used. However, our main requirement to it is, that it should create
%
%As a partition of the initial graphs into non-overlapping subgraphs has obviously a great impact on the quality of the solution, we suggest an update rule, whose aim is to improve existing partition using obtained correspondences between nodes of two graphs.
%
%our approach iteratively tries to improve initial subdivision of the graphs and matches again the subproblems. The update rule

%
%It continuous until we do not achieve an improvement in several successive iterations.
%
%
% A resulting solution is then combined from local solutions of single subproblems. A disadvantage of such an approach is however, that a runtime improvement is sometimes paid with a drop in the accuracy.
%Due to that, one want to have a trade off between speed up and accuracy. What is more important depends on a particular problem.
