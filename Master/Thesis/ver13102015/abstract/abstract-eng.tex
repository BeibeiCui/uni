Graph matching is one of the fundamental problems in graph theory and computer vision. Due to its practical relevance this problem is heavily investigated and there are a lot of approximative algorithms for solving it.
However a lot of algorithms are able to work efficiently only with small graphs (up to $100$ nodes) and scale poorly for bigger graphs. In this thesis we introduce a novel approach for extension of the usability of existing graph matching algorithms to bigger graphs. For that we introduce a two level graph matching framework. Two given graphs to match represent the lower level. To reduce problem size we partition each of the graphs into fix number of subgraphs and capture each subgraph with a node of a new (anchor) graph, that is placed on the second higher level. To solve initial matching problem we iteratively solve first matching problem on the higher level, which gives us correspondences between nodes of two anchor graphs. Afterwards we find in parallel correspondences between nodes of the matched subgraphs pairs. To improve initial partition before next iteration we introduce an update rule, which allows the subgraphs to exchange nodes on their border. We demonstrate effectiveness of our approach in matching synthetic graphs and finding correspondences between pairs of images.
