I would like to use the opportunity to acknowledge help of the people, who led me through and stood by during my work on this master thesis.

First of all, I would like to express my thanks to my supervisor Prof.~Dr.~Bj\"{o}rn Ommer for the opportunity to work on the interesting topic, for his wise supervision, patience and support. I also would like to express my gratitude to Borislav Antic for his valuable suggestions and discussions regarding the topic of this thesis. I venerate their passion to the science and am grateful for ability to inspire everybody around them with it.

The thanks goes to my colleagues in the Computer Vision group for pleasant working atmosphere and for many funny moments during my presence in the group.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their endless believe in me. Especially, to my farther, Mikhail Tikhonchev, and boyfriend, Michael Sutter, for their patience to read this work and help with the English grammar, for cheering me up and just for they being always there for me when I needed.

Thank you!
